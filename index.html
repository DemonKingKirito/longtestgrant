        <ol id="olf">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):</strong> Cloud providers offer virtualized computing
                    resources, including servers, storage, and networking, over the internet. Users can rent these
                    resources on a pay-as-you-go basis, enabling them to scale their infrastructure up or down based on
                    demand without the need for physical hardware.</li>
                <li><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS):</strong> PaaS provides a platform allowing developers to
                    build, deploy, and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. Cloud
                    providers handle tasks such as managing servers, middleware, and runtime environments, allowing
                    developers to focus on writing code and delivering applications more quickly.</li>
                <li><strong>Software as a Service (SaaS):</strong> SaaS delivers software applications over the internet
                    on a subscription basis. Users can access these applications through a web browser without the need
                    for installation or maintenance. SaaS offerings range from email and productivity tools to customer
                    relationship management (CRM) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) software.</li>
                <li><strong>Storage and Backup:</strong> Cloud computing provides scalable storage solutions, allowing
                    businesses to store and back up data securely in the cloud. Users can access their data from
                    anywhere with an internet connection, and cloud storage offerings typically include features such as
                    data replication, encryption, and versioning for enhanced security and reliability.</li>
                <li><strong>Big Data Analytics:</strong> Cloud platforms offer tools and services for collecting,
                    storing, processing, and analyzing large volumes of data. Users can leverage cloud-based data
                    warehouses, analytics tools, and machine learning services to gain insights, make data-driven
                    decisions, and drive innovation.</li>
                <li><strong>Content Delivery and Streaming:</strong> Cloud-based content delivery networks (CDNs) enable
                    efficient and reliable delivery of web content, streaming media, and software downloads to users
                    around the world. CDNs cache content on servers located closer to end-users, reducing latency and
                    improving performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Development and Testing:</strong> Cloud computing facilitates agile software development and
                    testing by providing on-demand access to development and testing environments. Developers can
                    provision resources quickly, collaborate more effectively, and accelerate the software development
                    lifecycle.</li>
                <li><strong>Internet of Things (IoT):</strong> Cloud platforms offer services for managing and analyzing
                    data generated by connected devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. Businesses can
                    collect, store, process, and analyze sensor data in the cloud to derive actionable insights,
                    optimize operations, and deliver new services.</li>

        <h2>Disdvantages</h2>
        <img src="53986799b0f42df1d99ddfe60ac69b25.jpg" alt="" id="image-right">
        <!-- Give 5 disadvantages and Description of Cloud Computing using the ul listing -->
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Security Concerns:</strong> Cloud computing raises security concerns related to data privacy,
                compliance, and the risk of unauthorized access. Storing sensitive data in the cloud requires trust in
                the security measures implemented by the cloud provider, and breaches or vulnerabilities could lead to
                data loss, theft, or exposure.</li>
            <li><strong>Dependency on Internet Connectivity:</strong> Cloud computing relies on internet connectivity
                for accessing services and data stored in the cloud. If there are internet outages or disruptions, users
                may experience downtime and loss of access to critical resources, affecting productivity and business
                operations.</li>
            <li><strong>Limited Control and Customization:</strong> With cloud computing, users relinquish some control
                over the underlying infrastructure and software. Cloud providers dictate the features, configurations,
                and upgrade schedules of their services, limiting users' ability to customize and optimize their
                environments according to their specific needs and preferences.</li>
            <li><strong>Potential for Downtime and Service Disruptions:</strong> Despite robust infrastructure and
                redundancy measures, cloud services are not immune to downtime and service disruptions. Technical
                issues, maintenance activities, and outages at the cloud provider's end can result in temporary loss of
                access to services, impacting business continuity and user experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost Overruns and Lock-In:</strong> While cloud computing offers cost savings and flexibility,
                it can also lead to cost overruns and vendor lock-in if not managed effectively. Uncontrolled usage,
                unexpected fees, and lack of visibility into resource consumption can inflate cloud bills, while
                reliance on proprietary technologies and APIs may make it challenging to migrate to alternative
                providers or platforms in the future.</li>
        </ul>

        your daily life in schools and personal uses, Will you also recommend 
        using cloud for the others -->
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Storage and Backup:</strong> Cloud storage solutions such as Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive
                offer ample storage space for storing lecture notes, assignments, projects, and personal documents.
                These platforms provide accessibility from any device with an internet connection and ensure data backup
                and synchronization, minimizing the risk of data loss.</li>
            <li><strong>Collaboration and Sharing:</strong> Cloud-based productivity tools like Google Workspace
                (formerly G Suite) and Microsoft Office 365 enable real-time collaboration on documents, presentations,
                and spreadsheets. Students can work together on group projects, share resources, and provide feedback
                seamlessly, regardless of their locations.</li>
            <li><strong>Access to Educational Resources:</strong> Cloud-based educational platforms and learning
                management systems (LMS) provide access to course materials, lecture recordings, eBooks, and online
                resources. Students can engage in self-paced learning, access supplementary materials, and participate
                in virtual classrooms or discussions, enhancing their educational experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Remote Learning:</strong> Cloud computing facilitates remote learning by providing access to
                virtual classrooms, video conferencing tools, and online collaboration platforms. Especially during
                times of remote or hybrid learning, cloud-based solutions enable students to attend classes, interact
                with instructors, and submit assignments from anywhere with an internet connection.</li>
            <li><strong>Organization and Time Management:</strong> Cloud-based productivity apps, calendars, and task
                management tools help students stay organized, manage their schedules, and track deadlines effectively.
                These tools offer reminders, notifications, and synchronization across devices, empowering students to
                prioritize tasks and manage their time efficiently.</li>
